Gas(1) - prefork WSGI server and app for streaming static files
============================================================

## SYNOPSIS

python -m gas [-a<app>] [-c [<arg>][...]] [-h<host>] [-p<port>] [-n<n>]

## DESCRIPTION

Gas is a tiny prefork WSGI server and app for streaming static files through grep-, awk- and sed-like generators.  It was written as an efficient and reusable way to expose filesystems over HTTP for use in internal tools at OpenDNS.  There are no plans to serve external traffic through Gas.

The server itself is a combination of Jacob Kaplan-Moss's Python translation of Ryan Tomayko's Ruby prefork echo server, PEP-333's example WSGI server and app, and Tornado's HTTP parsing.  Little of the implementation is original thought but that serves to make it a bit more bulletproof.

Without GET parameters, the child processes will happily stream files back to clients.  GET parameters may be added to repeatedly grep, awk (soon) and sed (soon) the output.  No extra processes are forked; instead, the common functionality of these utilities is implemented simply in Python generators.  GET parameters are processed in order to create a pipeline.  A parameter may be passed more than once to process the output with that command more than once.

## INSTALLATION

Installation is through Python distutils.

## OPTIONS

* --help:
  Show a help message.
* -a MODULE, --app=MODULE:
  Path to Python WSGI callable.  This uses the PYTHONPATH.
* -c, --construct:
  Construct a WSGI callable with the remaining arguments.  If not given, the WSGI app given to -a will be used as-is.
* -h HOST, --host=HOST:
  Hostname to bind to.
* -p PORT, --port=PORT:
  Port number to bind to.
* -n N:
  Number of children to fork().  Each child will accept() new connections repeatedly and will never be respawned.
